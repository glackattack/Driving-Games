MOST CURRENT VERSION IS IN THE FOLDER MARKED DRIVING-GAMES
Download the entire thing and then run either drivingtrack.py or drivingwithobstacles.py
You may need to add a blank init file in your folder structures to get python to open sub-directories. Not sure if Git Hub keeps those in the upload

Other files here are older versions i'm not sure how to archive yet...

PREVIOUS RELEASE NOTES:
Split out a bunch of the code from drivingtrack.py in an effort to clean up the code and better understand all the individual components.
drivingwithobstacles is pretty much the same as it was
map.py contains the track information for drivingtrack.py
start_state.py are the initial conditions
base_car.py contain the attributes of the car. size, acceleration, drag, turning radius
color_sheme.py is the base version of the color scheme with black, red, and green
cool_color_scheme.py is a more subdued calm color scheme and shows how switching between the two is easy

alpha version
updated 3/28/18
